Hello, my name is Ricardo and today i will tell you why i chose higher vocational training degree in web application developer as a branch of studies, all starts when i was twelve i began at disassambing my toys to see how
it was in the inside, and then i started searching for information to understan how it works ,by the time when i was fifteen  i started learning how to build a pc after that few months after i buit my first PC, and the fact that it 
worcked at my very frist try, it encouraged to keep studying, when i was 19 i started learing how to code and 
i make a few easy apps to test my codes, before finishg technological high school I already knew that I didn't want to go to university, and this course was the best option to do. After i finished the higher vocational training degree
i starded working in a company that specializes in cybersecurity and im very happy here, in my working day i code a lot, I supervise the code works perfectly and i do the maintenance of the servers where is all the data of our clients
im very pround of my desition and i will be working on this sector for a while.
I hope to see your around! 
Ricardo.
