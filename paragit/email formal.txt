Dear Director,
I am writing in reference to the lack of keyboards in 346 class, this morning while I was doing my class, a few students complained about  the fact that
local PCs doesnâ€™t have enough keyboards so I will need to take some from the storage.
Taking advantage of this opportunity I would really appreciate if you could give me a date to
 have a conversation with you to discuss the issue with the software that we are using currently in the school, it has important issues and sometimes the changes I make in a document 
are not kept, I will write you all the details in a report.
I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sinserly,
Ricardo.
